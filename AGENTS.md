# Agent guide

Routing and integrity rules for coding agents (and people) working in this repository: a matching decompilation of
the PSP game Hot Shots Tennis: Get a Grip. The detailed rules live in the documents below; this file says which one
to read for which task and lists the rules that are never relaxed.

## Read first

| Task | Read |
| --- | --- |
| Setting up, the tools, the source header keys | [docs/GUIDE.md](docs/GUIDE.md) (Setup, Verify, Source conventions, Tools) |
| Matching a function: method, file format, note line, source quality, near misses | [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) |
| Compiler behaviour (saves many compiles) | [docs/MWCC-DIGEST.md](docs/MWCC-DIGEST.md), then the newest lines of the append-only log [docs/MWCC-NOTES.md](docs/MWCC-NOTES.md) |
| What counts as done, and the progress tiers | [docs/COMPLETION.md](docs/COMPLETION.md), [docs/PROGRESS.md](docs/PROGRESS.md) |
| Prompting a matching agent for one batch | [docs/LANE-PROMPT-TEMPLATE.md](docs/LANE-PROMPT-TEMPLATE.md) |

The maintainers' tree also holds the external-lane brief (`docs/LANE-TASK.md`, `docs/AGENT-BRIEF.md`) and the lane
and push scripts; `tools/hstpublish.py` (`PRIVATE_PATHS`) keeps those, and the accepted ledger, out of the public
repository. Where the brief and this file disagree, the stricter rule applies.

## Kinds of work

- **Matching** (most work): one function at a time, by the method in CONTRIBUTING.md. Experiments go in your own
  directory under `try/` (gitignored); an EXACT source goes to `src/<module dir>/`; a close attempt goes to `wip/`.
  Agents running as a lane stay inside their lane directory and follow their prompt.
- **Tools.** The verdict depends on the comparison code (`tools/hstmatch.py`, `hstpromote.py`, `hstproof.py`,
  `hstgate.py`, `hstconfig.py`), the compiler profiles and `include/`. The toolchain lock
  (`data/toolchain-manifest.json`) hashes all of them, so a change there is finished only when
  `python tools/hstpromote.py migrate-toolchain --reason "..."` has reverified every accepted proof under the new
  toolchain and written the lock; if any proof fails, the change is wrong, not the proof. Add synthetic, game-free
  tests (`tools/test_*.py`, each runnable as `python tools/test_<name>.py`).
- **Accepted ledger and publishing** are maintainer work: `tools/hstpromote.py` is the only writer of
  `data/accepted-ledger.jsonl`, `data/accepted-journal.jsonl` and the two lock files; the public tree is built by
  the maintainers' release tooling. Agents never push, publish or rewrite history.

## Integrity rules (never relaxed)

- **Only EXACT counts.** A source is a match only when `python tools/hstmatch.py <file>` reports `EXACT` for the
  installed file: the compiled and linked bytes equal retail with no masking. A maintainer re-verifies every
  harvested source; a claim without matcher output is not a result.
- **Real source only.** No machine code in a source: no `asm` statements that emit instructions, no
  `.word`/`.byte`/`.incbin`, no code-emitting pragmas, no data steered into `.text`, no `extra=` header or `--flags`
  result in `src/`. `tools/hstgate.py` refuses such a source (`EXACT_FAILS_GATE`). Allowed `asm`, reported as
  idioms: a `register T x asm("$N")` binding, an empty `asm("" ::: "memory")` barrier, and **inline VFPU asm
  where the original SDK or game code used it** (owner decision 2026-10-27, the LittleBigPlanet rule): the header
  says `asm=vfpu`, a line starting `Original inline VFPU asm:` gives the reason, and every instruction in the
  asm is a VFPU instruction (no other instruction, label or VFPU branch; loads/stores as `offset(%N)`, or a bare
  `%N` whose constraint is `"m"` for a local or parameter; the only directives are the SDK's
  `.set push`/`noreorder`/`pop` style mode switches). Write everything else in C; one non-VFPU instruction makes it `asm-emit` again.
- **No steering tricks presented as code.** Avoid duplicated conditions, dummy locals or parameters, `volatile`,
  self-assignments and gratuitous casts or `goto`; when one is the only exact form found, keep it and name it in the
  note line ("matching idiom: ..."). Note lines must be true.
- **Relocatable.** Name every address through a symbol (`FUN_`/`DAT_` address names, or a line appended to
  `symbols/<module>.txt`), never through a numeric constant cast to a pointer. Decode `lui`/low-half pairs with the
  sign-extended low half before naming a symbol.
- **Never edit the verdict.** Do not edit `tools/` as part of a matching change, do not edit or delete existing
  lines of `symbols/` (append only), and never hand-edit the ledger, journal or lock files.
- **Never lower a figure.** A change that would drop accepted bytes or lower a progress figure is refused, not
  worked around; `hstpromote.py` refuses a promotion that loses coverage, and only an explicit `retract` with a
  reason removes accepted bytes.
- **No game material.** Never commit or send retail modules, decrypted assets, disassembly dumps of whole modules,
  keys, saves or private captures, and never send retail bytes or disassembly to an external service. Keep
  machine-specific paths in the gitignored `hst-config.json`.
- **Shared resources.** Use `--parallel 4` at most for `hstmatch.py`; do not run the tools that write into `src/`
  (`hstgen`, `hstclone`, `hsttmpl`, `hstperm`, `hstnewlib`) or build batches (`hstqueue`) unless the maintainer asked;
  do not search recursively outside `src/`, `wip/`, `docs/`, `symbols/`, `include/` and your own `try/` directory.
