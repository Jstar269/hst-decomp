This project rebuilds the code of *Hot Shots Tennis: Get a Grip* (PSP, UCUS98701), also known as *Everybody's Tennis
Portable*, as C and C++. A function counts as matched only when the original compiler turns its source into exactly
the bytes in the game.

It covers both of the game's program files: the main game (`EBOOT.BIN`) and the Sharing Version
(`hstp_trans_main.prx`), the trial copy that one PSP sends to another over wireless Game Sharing.

The repository holds source only and doesn't build a playable game on its own. To play on a PC, use
[Nakagawa Recomp](https://github.com/Jstar269/nakagawa-recomp) with your own copy of the game. The screenshot below
is from that build. It is the only game imagery in this repository; the logo, artwork and on-screen text belong to
their owners, are shown only to identify the game, and are not covered by this project's licences.

## Progress at a glance

<!-- hstprogress:begin readme-glance -->

| | Progress | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| **Code matched** | **37.2%** | 12,513 of the 19,634 game functions are rewritten as C or C++ that compiles to the game's exact bytes. This is the figure decompilation trackers such as [recomp.fyi](https://recomp.fyi) show. |
| **Built from source** | **29.9%** | The share of the game's program files that the full build already reproduces, byte for byte, from this source. |

The project's own finish line is stricter: the whole build must also work when moved to another address, and every source must be reviewed by a person. That figure is 0.0%. Measured 2026-10-29.

<!-- hstprogress:end -->

Decompilation projects usually count a game as done when both numbers reach 100%. Charts and history are in the
[progress report](docs/PROGRESS.md).

## Check the matches yourself

The repository isn't open to outside contributions yet ([CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)). You can re-check every
published match on your own machine:

1. Bring your own copy of the game. The tools need its two executables in decrypted form; this repository contains
   no decryption code and does not explain how to decrypt them.
2. Install the compilers in WSL and set up the campaign directory: [Setup](docs/GUIDE.md#setup).
3. Run `python tools/hstmatch.py --all`.

[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) describes how a function is matched, and the compiler lessons are in
[`docs/MWCC-NOTES.md`](docs/MWCC-NOTES.md).

## Progress in detail

<!-- hstprogress:begin readme-progress -->

**12,510 exact sources** (12,513 functions) and 1,112 near misses, measured 2026-10-29 with `python tools/hstcov.py`
and counted in code bytes:

| Module | Matched / functions | Matched / code bytes | Share of bytes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `EBOOT.BIN` | 6,367 / 9,804 | 1,114,864 / 2,849,076 | 39.131 % |
| `hstp_trans_main.prx` (Sharing Version) | 6,146 / 9,830 | 1,030,360 / 2,914,004 | 35.359 % |
| **Both** | 12,513 / 19,634 | 2,145,224 / 5,763,080 | 37.224 % |

<!-- hstprogress:end -->

Every source is re-verified with `python tools/hstmatch.py` before it is published. These figures count each function
matched on its own. The stricter tiers (the whole executables rebuilt from source, data included, relocatable and
reviewed) are defined in [`docs/COMPLETION.md`](docs/COMPLETION.md), and [`docs/PROGRESS.md`](docs/PROGRESS.md)
charts them.

## How the sources are made

Tools produce most of the sources. Where the game contains the same code more than once, a tool reuses a function that
already matches; other tools translate decompiler output into C. AI agents work on the functions the tools can't
match, under the maintainer's direction.

Every source passes the same checks. An automatic checker compiles it with the original compiler and accepts it only
if it produces exactly the original bytes, and a second gate rejects fake matches, such as machine code pasted in as
assembly instead of written as C. [What the sources are](docs/GUIDE.md#what-the-sources-are) breaks them down by how
they were made.

## Legal

No game assets, executables, keys, decryption code or compilers are in this repository, except the presentation
screenshot shown above, and nothing in it lets you obtain the game. You install the compilers yourself from
[decomp.me's kits](https://github.com/decompme/compilers) and [wibo](https://github.com/decompals/wibo), under their
vendors' licences ([THIRD_PARTY.md](THIRD_PARTY.md)).

[GitHub private reporting](https://github.com/Jstar269/hst-decomp/security/advisories/new) or the contact on the

appropriate.
