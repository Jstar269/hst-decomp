"""Progress against docs/COMPLETION.md: the tier ladder T1-T4, the strict headline, and the public-eligible figures.

    python tools/hstprogress.py                  print the figures (nothing is written)
    python tools/hstprogress.py --write          write progress.json, today's row of docs/progress.csv and the visuals
                                                 (docs/progress*.svg, drawn by tools/hstviz.py) and
                                                 docs/objdiff-report.json (tools/hstreport.py: the objdiff report recomp.fyi reads)
    python tools/hstprogress.py --check-readme   compare the public code figure with the table in README.md and with
                                                 docs/objdiff-report.json, and every generated figure block (below)
                                                 with the figures measured now (exit 1 on a difference)
    python tools/hstprogress.py --private        also print the all-sources figures (they include unpublished Sony SDK
                                                 reconstructions and are never written to a file)
    python tools/hstprogress.py --proofs         count tier 1 from the accepted ledger (tools/hstproof.py) instead of
                                                 the sources present in src/

SCOPE (the denominator; it never shrinks). Every byte of the decrypted image of every module the campaign ledger tracks
(six modules): `scope_bytes`. Two smaller views of the same modules are printed for reference: the file-backed bytes of
the load segments (the part of the image that is mapped, what docs/COMPLETION.md's "about 20.6 %" was measured against)
and the bytes of the ledger's reviewed functions (what the README table counts). Functions that the toolchain cannot
reproduce (data/blocked_functions.json) stay in the denominator; they are shown as their own count.

TIERS (each a share of `scope_bytes`):

  T1  code bytes of functions with an exact source in src/ (isolation match, tools/hstmatch.py): a function counts when
      a source covers its start or a multi-function source's span, like tools/hstcov.py. Data is not matched yet, so T1
      is code only. Public files show the public-eligible T1 (origin classes tools/hstpublish.py keeps); the all-sources
      T1 includes the Sony SDK reconstructions and is printed with --private only.
  T2  bytes reproduced by the whole-module build from source: read from try/build/<module>-report.json written by
      tools/hstbuild.py (only bytes of compiled sources whose in-place link bytes equal retail count; scaffolding never
      counts). 0 while no such report exists.
  T3  T2 and the shifted build passes (gate 5): t3_source_bytes of build reports whose shifted build passed.
  T4  = STRICT headline: T3 and the source is human reviewed (gate 7): 0 until T3 exists. Nothing is estimated.

GENERATED FIGURE BLOCKS. The published figures in README.md (the progress table and the line above it),
docs/COMPLETION.md (the measured date and the T1-T4 figures), docs/GUIDE.md (the source-kind breakdown, from the
note line of every public source and its origin class, and the compiler profiles the sources' headers select) and
docs/PROGRESS.md (the full figure table) sit between `<!-- hstprogress:begin NAME -->` and
`<!-- hstprogress:end -->`; --write rewrites them and --check-readme checks every one. Do not edit them by hand.

docs/progress.csv keeps one row per day and source. The first rows were seeded from the figures the README showed
("readme:<commit>"); they are tier-1, public-eligible, code-byte figures over the two game modules' functions and stay
as they were (the columns up to `blocked_code_bytes`); newer rows add the scope and tier columns.
