"""Measure the capability milestones of data/milestones.json (defined in docs/COMPLETION.md).

    python tools/hstmilestones.py             print every milestone's progress (nothing is written)

tools/hstviz.py calls `compute()` and `record()`: the dashboard draws the milestones, and docs/milestones.json keeps the
first date each one reached 100%. A reached milestone that later measures below 100% is kept and flagged REGRESSED, so a
regression is visible instead of rewriting history.

Each measure reads its own evidence and never estimates:
  inventory  ledger regions reviewed / all region bytes of the six modules, and no open candidate span
  t1         matched code bytes / function bytes of the named modules (the view's sources: public or every source)
  t2, t3     whole-module build reports (try/build/<module>-report.json from tools/hstbuild.py): compiled-source bytes
             over the image (t2_source_bytes; t3_source_bytes of a shifted build that passed); reached only when every
             named image has the retail SHA-256 with no scaffolding (t3 also needs the shifted build's static check and
             its runtime scenario: shifted_build_passes true and shifted_runtime "passed")
  t4         the strict tier of hstprogress
  portable   try/port-report.json (or try/port-private-report.json with --private); source code bytes that compile for all five host targets
  platform   the PSP system functions the two game executables import (their .lib.stub tables), each looked up in
             Nakagawa Recomp's reviewed import audit (hst-config `nakagawa_root`); only status "complete" counts
  evidence   an entry in data/milestones.json "evidence" naming a recorded scenario
