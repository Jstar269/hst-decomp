   matching idiom: the "source = self->source" copy is written in both arms of the mode==3 test (it must stay a shared
   local), the count guard is spelled "<= 3" (a "< 4" test reuses the load register and loses retail's slti $at),
   the skipped-store path uses goto tail, and the mode chain is a descending ==-chain, not a switch. */
